# Workflow: 
=======
## Workflow/App lifecycle
App -> user: Display start button to start game
   ### Loop
    App -> GPU: Stream images to server
    GPU -> App: message ("LED Kicked" or "LED not kicked")
    App -> Board: tell board via bluetooth to switch off current LED and switch on new LED
    App -> GPU: If Last kick stop sending video and ask gpu for form analysis
    GPU -> App: Receive form analysis
    App -> user: Display form analysis to user + wait for user to start game again (game start button)
